ScrollingTile
=============
This game has a entity system and a level system.
You move around and the camera follows.

Black blocks and entities are collidable.

Controls:

WASD - Movement.
F - Generate new map.
N - NoClip.
M - NoRender.

TODO:

Add level loading mechanic that loads from a .map file.
Add maps that the level class holds instead of tiles, so that bigger levels can be made without huge FPS drops.
Maybe add A* Pathfinding?
